# Snake Game in JavaScript
This is a classic Snake game written in JavaScript without using the HTML5 canvas element for rendering graphics. The game is played by controlling a snake that moves around the screen and eating food to grow longer. The game is over when the snake collides with the walls or its own body.

## Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository-name>.git

Gameplay
The player controls the snake using the arrow keys on the keyboard. The snake starts with a length of 1 and moves in the direction of the arrow key that is pressed. When the snake eats a piece of food, its length increases by one and the player earns points. The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
